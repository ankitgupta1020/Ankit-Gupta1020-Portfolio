        <h2>Data Science: The Smart Technology You Don’t See</h2>
        <p>
            Data and analytics touch our lives every day. Sometimes, it is in ways you see, such as when you log on to a video call, pay for your bus ticket or order your latte using your phone. Or view spending trends on your bank account using an app or website. Data analytics are also at work in ways you don’t see — ways that make your life easier, safer, more convenient, and more fun — especially when it comes to getting where you want to go. Indeed, data analytics are working tirelessly behind the scenes to help you reduce your travel time, make getting from point A to point B easier, manage traffic congestion, and create safer and more accessible ways to use public transit.When you’re waiting to catch the bus to work, your phone app may tell you whether your ride is on schedule — and exactly how many minutes until the next buses arrive at your stop.

        <p>
            The auto industry continues to market electric cars as the "next best thing," and the newest generation of electric vehicles (EVs) are more than up to speed.Although widespread adoption of EVs took some time to find its footing in the United States and was slow to get off the ground, more car shoppers are seeing the benefits of EVs and hybrids. Several improvements in the latest models have helped overcome some hurdles that might have made buyers hesitant to embrace EVs.
